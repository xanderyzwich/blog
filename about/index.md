I'm a full time developer working in an enterprise Java shop working primarily on web services. I got my BS in Computer Engineering at the University of Memphis.

To me software development is a lot like playing a puzzle game. I enjoy figuring out ways to solve odd problems using common tools. One of my favorite things about this industry is talking with friends and coworkers about issues that they are facing and brainstorming solutions.

I look forward to sharing my development journey as frequently as work allows.
