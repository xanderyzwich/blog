		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning I woke up to find a comment had been made on an old answer that I&#39;d posted to Stack Overflow, and I opened up the site. Quickly I remembered why I don&#39;t enjoy using it. I had a reputation score of 46 and was unable to comment on anything other than my own answers. Without having much work that was pressing I decided to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I did was to read through posts and vote up any question or answer that I found interesting. Quickly I had finished the forty vote max for the day, and earned three badges (Citizen Patrol, Suffrage, and Vox Populi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next badge that came up for tracking was to edit a question that had been dormant for 6 months (Excavator). I set into the depths of #python posts. I quickly found many posts with irrelevant tags, missing tags, or poor wording, and I submitted some few dozen edits. Along the way I actually found a couple of questions that I could answer. After the first two edits were accepted I had gotten myself over the comment barrier of fifty reputation, and that was the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point something happened, and I started to enjoy the ability to comment in order to evoke more information on questions. Before I knew it, I had an answer accepted and jumped above seventy reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I opened up Stack Overflow and was greeted with having 105 reputation and 13 badges. After years of frustration with one of our most beneficial tools as a developer, I was able to break through in the span of one afternoon. I know that many of us have frustrations with that site and how difficult it can be when you are trying to ask questions (to this day I have not posted any question). But there are many ways that you can contribute to Stack Overflow that help to raise your reputation AND help get people answers to their questions.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://coreydmccarty.dev/posts/2019_08_13_starting_11ty/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started down this road after a simple engagement on Twitter with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/brob&quot;&gt;Brob&lt;/a&gt; and he suggested that I start blogging on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.to/&quot;&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt; and even went so far as to say that I should think about posting to my own site and syndicating over &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.to/&quot;&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt;.  At that point I had a custom domain without any clue what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-how&quot;&gt;But How &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#but-how&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily Brob went on to direct me &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ervT8kEx1k?amp=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a straight forward tool that can publish a personal blog using GitHub Pages and TravisCI.  The instructions are really easy and after having setup my custom domain through GitHub Pages already, I had this &#39;up and running&#39; within an hour.  This is where is really stalled for a while. At this point I had my build process up and running and could view the sample blog from my custom url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://coreydmccarty.dev/img/Generic11ty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Default Blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get Started &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#get-started&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting this thing go stagnant for too long made it feel progressively harder to get done.  The page gives clear instruction on first steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the _data/metadata.json with your blogâ€™s information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Edit .eleventy.js with your configuration preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete this message from _includes/layouts/base.njk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;edit-_data%2Fmetadata.json&quot;&gt;Edit _data/metadata.json &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#edit-_data%2Fmetadata.json&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Your Blog Name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://myurl.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;I am writing about my experiences as a naval navel-gazer.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;feed&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;subtitle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;I am writing about my experiences as a naval navel-gazer.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;filename&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;feed.xml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/feed/feed.xml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://myurl.com/feed/feed.xml&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://myurl.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Your Name Here&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;youremailaddress@example.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stuff is really easy.  I&#39;m starting to feel ashamed of having waited so long to work on this. All of the data here can be put together inside of 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;delete-this-message-from-_includes%2Flayouts%2Fbase.njk&quot;&gt;Delete this message from _includes/layouts/base.njk &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#delete-this-message-from-_includes%2Flayouts%2Fbase.njk&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hack off that one div.  Again I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting to be difficult in this setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#about&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to customize the &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; page that is linked in the top nav pane you will need to edit about/index.md. While the markdown spec is prolifically generic, if you have any experience with using markdown on Reddit, Discord, or GitHub then it is pretty easy to use. Personally I am writing this through IntelliJ Community Edition with Markdown Support plugin and I&#39;m able to see the output in realtime. Put in some basic information that you would like to be displayed on your page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-blogging&quot;&gt;Start Blogging &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#start-blogging&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting these things all completed you can start writing your first blog entry.  I&#39;m writing this entry as I complete the work that I&#39;m describing.  While working I have Eleventy running as &lt;code&gt;npx eleventy --server --watch&lt;/code&gt; so that the build picks up whatever changes I make and automatically serves them for viewing in the browser (I&#39;d hate to be publishing this without first testing that it works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing this post I was able to get an image included using the included html templating language with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/Generic11ty.bmp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I have gotten the blog up and running with my custom information so that it feels more like mine and less like some code that I forked and forgot about.  While I&#39;m not exactly a frontend developer, I plan on sharing my future work on some custom css as well as my online resume generator.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Discovering My Impostor Syndrome</title>

		<description>Coming to better understanding of my skill level</description>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve now been working as a developer for five years, but along the way I never felt like my skill level had improved. During that time I had spent four solid years working on the same application with a number of very talented developers who knew a great deal more than I. It was great as I was able to learn so many different things about our application and all of the technology and systems directly around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bit-about-our-application&quot;&gt;A Bit About Our Application &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#a-bit-about-our-application&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We owned and maintained a data storage solution that served CRUD operations as a Java web service over SOAP requests. We deployed into a Tomcat instance that we also owned and managed using a &#39;pipeline&#39; that consisted of a build server where we checked out code from SVN repository, compiled, and then pushed out into our application servers (RedHat VM&#39;s that were ours alone); all of which was being done with our custom written bash scripts which were highly interdependent. Our data storage was a mix of Oracle SQL Server and Datastax/Cassandra NoSQL clusters. We utilize Java Messaging Services (JMS) to publish messages out to people interested in updates to the data, and Java Management Extensions (JMX) to trigger various processes in our application from outside the already running Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-the-meta&quot;&gt;Back to the Meta &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#back-to-the-meta&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, along the many years of supporting and managing this application I became deeply intimate with it&#39;s inner workings (some of my peers would refer to ME as the Subject Matter Expert).  During the majority of this time my primary duties did NOT include writing changes to the Java code itself.  The program is &#39;wired&#39; via some controlling tables in the database that tell it where data is and how to handle it. Due the the nature of this application, there were design choices made that meant that it was not a good fit for pulling out large data set, but should be queried as specifically as possible. As such, clients had to be advised as to how they might fit their logic flow into our data access methodologies.  There was a great deal of working with these client teams to model their data and the ways that they would access it so that neither their application nor ours was negatively affected.  &lt;strong&gt;I became a specialist in this application.&lt;/strong&gt;  That implied a great deal of knowledge in how our environment functioned.  I thought that this was just how everyone worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-for-a-new-team&quot;&gt;Time for a New Team &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#time-for-a-new-team&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the four years that I spent with that team, I was granted a transfer into another team for an adjacent application.  In the early months with this team I have had the privilege to go into a cloud training and redesigning one of the applications to adopt a new tool set and environment.  We are moving from WebLogic deployed XML configured Java (still SOAP) web service into Springboot with a Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment.  Most of our developers were VERY excited about attending these sessions for eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we work through moving files over from the old project into the new, there is a lot of finding and string replacing, and the like.  After having become pretty fluent in SED, GREP, FIND, and use of IntelliJ, these tasks were pretty simple and I would rattle off Bash commands to make it happen.  This is when I started getting the comments about being a &#39;bash wizard&#39; or &#39;command line guru&#39; as apparently nobody else on the team is as comfortable with these things.  When it comes time to find occurrences of things and usages throughout the entirety of our project Eclipse proved to be a poor tool for the job as it was very slow and cumbersome to deal with.  IntelliJ on the other hand offers quick tools for these things.  Again, I hear sighs and comments about &#39;we know, IntelliJ is better&#39; as everyone around me continues using Eclipse and Spring Tool Suite.  Many of the developers on this team have been coding for more than a decade, and are respecting of my seemingly well formed opinion on things.  ** &lt;strong&gt;MIND BLOWN&lt;/strong&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;am-i-a-senior%3F&quot;&gt;Am I a Senior? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#am-i-a-senior%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;m forced to evaluate whether my previous thoughts of being a junior to --maybe-- mid level developer could be largely mistaken.  After having gotten a deep knowledge around some subjects (even beyond the engineering classes in college) I somehow managed to &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; overlook the value of my skill set.  I have done all that I know how in terms of assisting anyone that I know with high level troubleshooting of issues that they may be facing in whatever development work that they might have as well as working with some online communities to help people learn programming and overcome issues that they may be facing.  Looking back, I do realize that most of the times I can help them at least find the direction to look in for finding the cause of their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;impostor-syndrome&quot;&gt;Impostor Syndrome &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#impostor-syndrome&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawns on me only after this realization that the standard explanation of &amp;quot;believing that someone will discover you as a phony&amp;quot; might not encompass all of what entails impostor syndrome.  My belief wasn&#39;t that I&#39;d be found as a phony, but instead that the position that I held was of little importance and skill; especially as most of my work didn&#39;t involve writing &#39;code&#39;.  I&#39;m just now coming to realize that having been so far junior to the peers in my old team led me to a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; skewed view of what is junior.  I had been given tasks thought to be below the rest of my team and just believed that these were super easy, and not that my skills were sufficient that I was getting bigger work than a fresh graduate would be given.  Complex data manipulation with hand written scripts and giant Bash one-liners isn&#39;t something that someone exactly understands right out of school, but it would be something that I did as a &#39;menial&#39; task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much material already out there on impostor syndrome, I still never understood it to be quite what I&#39;ve experienced.  These random thoughts might be a bit off on the definition of what most people would consider the syndrome to be, but overall I feel like the intention comes down very much to the same thing.  I really hope that this helps somebody else along their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>Best practices must evolve</description>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;traditional-best-practices&quot;&gt;Traditional Best Practices &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#traditional-best-practices&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically accepted that any code that is needed in more than one place should be abstracted away somewhere.  Classes with repeated logic get methods, packages with repeated logic get classes, projects with repeated logic get dependency projects.  It makes sense.  You don&#39;t want to update the code in many places, just do it once and let it trickle through the code base, and when you moved jar files manually from output of one project into another for usage then you could be pretty confident that things would remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-the-cloud!&quot;&gt;To the Cloud! &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#to-the-cloud!&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you move a legacy java web service into the modern era then a few things happen. SOAP becomes REST (I wish), XML becomes annotations and Java configuration classes, and you move from a traditional servlet container (Tomcat, WebLogic, etc) into Springboot jars (typically with Tomcat baked in). Something that should also happen between Y2K and cloud native application deployment would be a modern build tool with an artifact repository.  We&#39;re moving from Ant to Gradle, and utilizing a Nexus artifact repository for our dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all great, and I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying the learning that I&#39;m getting in this position. But, our application has a spiderweb of 6 &#39;common&#39; dependency jars that we own.  The application that we are currently upgrading uses 4 of them.  There is one for each of two databases (logical) and then there is a SUPER DEPENDENCY that all of the others inherit EVERYTHING from.  To make things even more difficult, the application that we are working on depends directly on the SUPER jar as well as three jars that then depend on the SUPER jar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENTER HEARTACHE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gradle is a wonderful tool. After our having gotten it working, I realized that local environment setup means being on the right git branch and having some environment variables setup for running the application so that we don&#39;t accidentally commit passwords while working around things that are done by our CI/CD.  Along the way however, there were many pain points.  Logging dependencies are apparently buried in every single thing that we use, and apparently SLF4J was being pulled down by the dozens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are told that the original architect and developer of our application was an absolute genius.  We are not.  This thing implemented it&#39;s own hibernate, property handler, application context, and many other things that are gotten for free with modern build tools, frameworks, and dependency injection; and many of these features are implemented deep within our dependency jars.  Particularly the application context and property handler were implemented all the way down in the SUPER jar.  They required access to a particular property file on the filesystem where the application resides.  I can see where that would have made the management of some dozen applications more uniform and easily understood.  When you deploy into a Cloud Foundry environment then the file system isn&#39;t exactly something that is at your disposal.  We have overcome this by adopting a configuration server to serve property files from git through a web server that makes them immediately available to any server making request for it.  SUPER jar doesn&#39;t like that.  FILE NOT FOUND meets NULL POINTER and everything breaks. Refactoring the four dependencies has been deemed outside the scope of our seven week engagement with the cloud foundry team that is helping us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;solutions&quot;&gt;Solutions &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#solutions&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually managed some quick fixes to make things work, and were given the confidence by our business team that we will be working on a complete ground up redesign of our applications in the future where we would have the opportunity to make corrections to the things that caused us so many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java configuration classes replaced each of our XML files that were used previously, and we were able to force feed the home baked application context with properties from the configuration server, and overcome some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we found an issue with our Junit design that meant that initialization was attempting to read that same property file, and we were able to overcome this by a quick fix to the SUPER jar to make direct use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;${foo}&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; notation and commenting away the file read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradle build file required a &lt;strong&gt;TON&lt;/strong&gt; of excluding to prevent duplication of dependencies (which may or may not have been based in different groups).  We have decided that these common jars should not be so interdependent because we currently require touching of six projects in order to make one work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any stories, recommendations, or solutions that you&#39;ve come across for such thing then I ask that you please comment.&lt;/p&gt;
