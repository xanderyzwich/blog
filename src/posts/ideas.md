I encountered a tech community that is very LGBTQIA affirming and accepting, and it felt alienating to me. It felt alienating because as a conservative, white, christian, cis-male I usually experience an amount of freedom that others don't have. While it felt like alienation it was actually just a loss of privilege in that space. It would take me a while before I came to understand that. In my privilege I had found myself even questioning why asexual people would identify with the LGBTQ community and not with the majority community. The ability to even see it that way was my privilege. I'd never been made to feel alien by the fact that I'm not heterosexually attracted. **When given that perspective it's much easier to realize that someone who experienced that might feel more comfortable with the LGBTQ community than with a heteronormative community**. I may have been picked on as a kid because I wasn't interested in sports and wasn't particularly athletic, but I was never made to question my own identity. I have gone through some phases where I dressed pretty weird, but I never had to worry about people judging me as being wrong for the clothes that I wore. As someone who has felt weak and powerless in different scenarios, and I know that the only way that I was able to overcome those feelings was to feel like I actually belonged in some group, like SOMEBODY was on my side.

SideNote: the differentiation of communities will cause question of why they should be different
