Original Title: Advancement Isn't a Zero Sum Game

Original Description: It's much easier to advance in your career when you foster a community that is interested in  advancement. 

Supplemental Details: This is the cornerstone of what has led me to move beyond a jr developer (of 5 years) and how I was able to contribute to others advancing their careers with many transitioning to development without college or as a second career.

## Introduction (1 minute)
-- per Dave Bor: you should take time up front to introduce yourself and your session and then dive into the subject matter

I have nearly 9 years of experience as a software developer, following my completion of a computer engineering degree in college. Throughout the majority of my career, I have focused on developing backend systems utilizing Java and Springboot. However, I have also gained proficiency in frontend work using Javascript and Vue over the past few years. Currently, I hold a leadership role where I manage a team of two other developers for a company specializing in the education of physical therapists and related professions.

During the initial stages of my career, I was employed by a large company that operated with separate teams who largely functioned independently. This work environment fostered a culture where everyone worked in isolation. Consequently, I found my professional growth to be stagnant, and I struggled to secure new job opportunities for a couple of years. My career trajectory took an upward turn when I joined an online developer community, where I ultimately discovered the missing piece required for advancing my career.

## The Myth of the Zero Sum Game (3 minutes)

Have you ever worked with developers that kept to themselves, and seemed to hoard knowledge like a dragon? It's really frustrating isn't it? They seem to want nothing more than to hole away in their silo and keep all of the information for themselves. This ultimately alienates new team members and causes them to waste a great deal of time discovering what the others already know. It's disheartening and mostly just hinders the team as a whole. 

This spirit is sometimes related to the premise of a zero-sum game, which is a situation in where one person's gain or success is exactly balanced by another person's loss or failure. In other words, the total amount of resources, opportunities, or benefits in the scenario remains constant, so any advantage gained by one party must come at the expense of another. This concept is often used in economics, where the gains and losses of participants are directly proportional. But, when applied to team members, it just means that the team will be achieving less.  

Rather than fearing that recognizing your colleagues' achievements will hinder your own progress, it is important to realize that mentorship and teamwork actually enhance your overall value. A competent manager understands this and appreciates the collaborative spirit that leads to success in software development.

## The Power of Collaboration and Community (4 minutes)

A popular proverb I often encounter states, "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." I have observed this firsthand through the varying team cultures I have experienced in my career. In teams where individuals work exclusively on their own tasks, it can be incredibly challenging, particularly for newcomers, to access crucial information and determine the most effective approach to a task. Acquiring the necessary information can feel like pulling teeth. I know that on more than one occasion I've been left to do some task and after far too much time researching and experimenting I mentioned that I was stuck and one of the senior developers told me exactly what the answer was and that it was something that he'd done before. It's as if they'd not paid a bit of attention when you'd discussed the problem previously. 

Conversely, in environments that prioritize collaboration and a culture of continuous learning, team members readily offer guidance and share their expertise when they identify a pattern or potential obstacle in a task you have undertaken. The difference in time spent on tasks between these two types of teams can be substantial. So much so that some people have taken this to the extreme of having an entire team work together doing group development at all times. This allows for the knowledge of everyone on the team to be leveraged to more quickly develop solutions as they arise without wasting so much time with a person going off to get stuck for some number of hours or days before getting help. 

## Creating a Culture of Advancement (4 minutes)

The best way to leverage this collaboration is by making it a part of your culture. When people come together regularly to discuss their work then you get a much shorter feedback loop. People tend to waste leess time, and have a better understanding of what oneanother is doing. By making collaboriation and discussion a central point in your team culture, you wind up with team members that are more likely to come together and help one another outside of meetings. 


When you extend this idea into fostering a culture of continuous learning, an exciting phenomenon occurs: people begin conversing with one another about their newfound knowledge and resources. Learning becomes an exponentially accelerated process as individuals share information, allowing for quicker progress and more knowledge dissemination. Rather than subscribing to the zero-sum game, I propose embracing John F Kennedy's notion that "a rising tide lifts all boats." When team members collectively enhance their knowledge base, each individual is propelled upwards and motivated to reach new heights.

While the impact of team culture on its members is well established, influencing a culture positively can seem overwhelming. Engaging in mentorship is one fundamental way to cultivate such a culture. In my opinion, everyone should ideally serve both as a mentor and have their own mentor. A mentor need not possess knowledge in all areas superior to your own, but should possess expertise in a specific domain to support your growth. Additionally, when you constantly strive for personal growth, you invariably acquire at least one area of expertise in which you can assist others who are less knowledgeable.

In addition to mentorship, there are several practices that a successful team can adopt to foster a culture of learning and progress, including:
- Regular knowledge-sharing sessions.
- Pair programming and code reviews.
- Providing opportunities for skill development.
- Encouraging collaboration between teams.

## Navigating Your Own Advancement (4 minutes)

Regardless of your career stage, your ability to learn and function within a team significantly influences your growth potential. Teams may consist solely of developers or encompass other roles such as Scrum Masters, Product Owners, Analysts, or System Administrators.

As an entry-level developer, your primary responsibility involves completing assigned tasks. To advance in this role, you should aim to tackle more complex assignments with reduced oversight. Ultimately, success in this stage hinges on your ability to locate better information more efficiently.

As a mid-level developer, you should excel at accomplishing individual tasks and begin grasping their broader implications within the overall system. Engaging in discussions with individuals less technically inclined and assisting other developers in finding the information they need should become part of your routine.

As a senior developer, you should employ your mentoring skills, interact with business partners, and contribute to strategic architectural decisions for applications.


## Conclusion (1 minute)

Let's come together and embrace the power of collaboration, mentorship, and a culture of continuous learning! By working together, supporting and guiding each other, and always seeking new knowledge, we can not only achieve personal growth but also foster a thriving team environment.
