Original Title: Advancement Isn't a Zero Sum Game

Original Description: It's much easier to advance in your career when you foster a community that is interested in  advancement. 

Supplemental Details: This is the cornerstone of what has led me to move beyond a jr developer (of 5 years) and how I was able to contribute to others advancing their careers with many transitioning to development without college or as a second career.

## Introduction
-- waiting for response from Dave Bor

## The Myth of the Zero Sum Game

Two of the worst principles that exist in software development are siloing and gatekeeping of knowledge. They both pivot on the idea of the zero sum game, or that somehow one person's gain or success means that someone else will lose or fail. Now, it's likely that some people feel that if they allow their peers to appear successful then it might cause them to miss out on some promotion or something, but a good manager will see and appreciate mentorship and strong teamwork as a part of your value. 

## The Power of Collaboration and Community

There's a proverb I hear quite often that says "If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together." In my career, I've seen this in the difference of team cultures. In teams where everyone does their own thing, it can be rather difficult for you, especially early in your career, to get all of the necessary information and figure out how to go about doing something. It's like pulling teeth to get the necessary information. On the other hand, if you have a culture of helping and learning then you are much more likely to have team members offer direction or wisdom from the beginning when they recognize a pattern or potential hangup with a task that you've taken. The difference in time spent between these two teams/cultures can be quite drastic. 

## Creating a Culture of Advancement 

Further, when you have a culture of learning, there's a fun thing tha happens where people start talking to one another about the things that they are learning and the resources that they've found. It becomes a compounding factor when people begin learning things faster because of what's been shared with them, and then they can quickly reach further points and begin sharing resources and things that they've learned. Instead of the zero-sum-game, I instead posit John F Kennedy's idea that "a rising tide lifts all boats." When the team knowledge rises, each team member will be motivated upward. 

So we understand that a team's culture can have a drastic impact upon it's members, but it can seem daunting to influence the culture for the better. One of the most basic ways of fostering this culture is by taking part in mentorship. I believe that ideally everyone should both be a mentor and have a mentor. A mentor doesn't have to know everything better than you, but should have some field of knowledge where they can help you to grow. Also, if you are constantly growing then you should quickly have at least one thing that you understand quite well and can help someone else that doesn't understand that thing. 

In addition to mentorship, there are a few things that a successful team could implement to foster a culture of learning and advancement. 
- Regular knowledge-sharing sessions.
- Pair programming and code reviews.
- Providing opportunities for skill development.
- Encouraging collaboration between teams.

## Navigating Your Own Advancement 

Regardless of your career stage, growth is heavily dependent upon your ability to learn and work in a team. Teams may be entirely made up of developers or might include Scrum Masters, Product Owners, Analysts, or System Admins. 

As a beginner developer you are responsible for completing the tasks put in front of you. In order to improve in this role and advance, you are looking to be able to complete more complex tasks with less direct oversight. It's all about learning how to find better information faster. 

As a mid-level developer you should already be pretty good at getting individual tasks done and begin understanding the impact that these tasks have on the overall system. You should begin engaging in discussions with less technical people in addition to assisting other developers with finding whatever information that they need. 

As a senior developer you should be mentoring, dealing with business partners, and helping to direct the overall architectural decisions for an application.
