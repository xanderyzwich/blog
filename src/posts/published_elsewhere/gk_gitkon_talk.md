Original Title: Advancement Isn't a Zero Sum Game

Original Description: It's much easier to advance in your career when you foster a community that is interested in  advancement. 

Supplemental Details: This is the cornerstone of what has led me to move beyond a jr developer (of 5 years) and how I was able to contribute to others advancing their careers with many transitioning to development without college or as a second career.

## Introduction (1 minute) - currently 1.8

It is a privilege to address you today as we delve into the exciting world of community and collaboration in software development. My name is Corey McCarty, and I have spent the past nine years fully immersed in the constantly evolving field of coding.

With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I have had the opportunity to work with various technologies, primarily focusing on Java with Springboot and Javascript with Vue. Currently, I am leading a dynamic team of developers. This responsibility has not only sharpened my technical skills, but has also deepened my understanding of the importance of cohesive collaboration.

My journey has led me to a unique environment - a small yet impactful company consisting of 35 individuals dedicated to the continuous education of physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and athletic trainers. Within this organization, technology serves as a conduit for professional growth, and our success is rooted in the strength of our community. I feel privileged to be a part of this team, as the company has a solid job security and has been thriving for over a decade.

As we embark on this exploration of how community and collaboration enhance the work of software developers, let us remember that our personal stories, experiences, and knowledge come together to form a tapestry of progress that enriches all of us.

I'd like to share my story and what I've learned about collaboration and career advancement. 

## The Myth of the Zero Sum Game (3 minutes) - currently 3.3 minutes

In my first job, I managed to fall into a support role for a number of years. This was tramendously underwhelming, but it taught me a lot about Bash scripting, waterfall development, debugging, and webservices in general. I had the mistaken understanding  that if I did the work assigned to me that my career would progress naturally. And, at this point I made an effort to interview for jobs at least every six months or so. It was in one such interview around my third year in this position that I really messed up. I had known very little about Spring Framework, only having been told that you don't mess with those xml files unless you know what you're doing. In this interview the room's walls were whiteboard and covered in notes from a previous meeting. I made the mistake of asking about the bits that mentioned Spring. Of course this led questioning what I know about Spring and how my team used it. I stumbled through some truly horrifying answers in hindsight, and as a surprise to noone, I didn't get the job. After that, I talked with a trusted coworker and discussed some resources for learning Spring Framework and Springboot.

You see there had been a strong pre-existing culture of just keeping your head down and getting your work done when I came into this team. There were people that already knew those other things, so you didn't need to go and learn them. This led to a lot of the more junior team members being isolated in just knowing bits and pieces of how things worked and being unable to do larger tasks without the more senior developers. This siloing and gatekeeping of knowledge happens a lot of time when people believe in what's called the 'zero sum game.' They have a belief that there are only so many promotions and acknowledgements to go around, so why should they help everyone else and make it harder for them to look superior. They'd rather cement their job security by being the only one that knows how to do things. Rather than fearing that recognizing your colleagues' achievements will hinder your own progress, it is important to realize that mentorship and teamwork actually enhance your overall value. A competent manager understands this and appreciates the collaborative spirit that leads to success in software development. And in the end, when you empower others to do more things on their own, it frees you up to do more interesting things.

## Creating a Culture of Advancement through Collaboration and Community (8 minutes) - currently 6.3

So, after that terrible interview, I spoke to a trusted coworker about this experience and we realized that we'd both been having the same problem. We found a really great resource for learning Spring, after I spent the time to go through and learn everything that I could about Spring I started feeling a lot more confident in my abilities as a developer.  I soon realized that this little bit of knowledge really helped me to understand our application where previously it'd just seemed like there was some magic ether that made things work. This made a really solid impact on my outlook and interactions at work. That trusted coworker and I began discussing our work and effectively pair programming through whatever issues we came across. I found myself talking more and more with the people around me about whatever they were learning and the more people that I interacted with in this way, the more helpful everyone seemed to be with one another as well. After having talked with many of the people around me I managed to get moved into another position where I would be doing more active development. 

It was on this new team where I would meet some of my favorite coworkers. We went through some training together to the ends of moving our application to the cloud. A central part of this training was pair programming, and that really brought our group together. On this team, my lead developer started calling me the 'bash guru' because I was moderately proficient with command line, and he wasn't. He'd been developing for around 10 years longer than me and he started mentoring me. He knew a great deal more than I did about application management, and general development while I knew more about bash and build pipelines. Our group of developers on that team started building a culture of improvement and learning and before the year was up two of use would actually be working elsewhere. I still talk to them to this day.

Community, in particular for developers, is a huge catalyst. It brings learning that you wouldn't likely pursue on your own. This is especially prounounced when you write code together. Pair/mob/group programming allows you to share techniques for debugging and for the actual finding and writing of code. Hotkeys and how to quickly find things in a large code base aren't exactly topics that would be covered in school, bootcamp, or general development books. Feedback and code review are really important for learning to write better code, but this when done in a group programming environment there is much more room for learning more things faster. Also, anytime that you are forced to talk about what you are doing in code using spoken language will improve your softskills. When you do this with non developers then you are further forced to abstract things in a different way, and this furthers your understanding of how something works. Einstein is often quoted as having said "If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself" and there's a lot of truth in that sentiment. Most of those things can be incorporated in your work team/community, but when your community extends beyond your own company then you can gain a lot more insight into the industry as a whole and trends that are emerging. I personally started picking these things up around that same time as I joined an online community called Code Connector, which I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for their wider software community.

Additionally, during this time need arose for our team to start working on our CICD pipeline. Honestly, from what I knew about the applications this team owned it would be much more fun to play with a new CICD pipeline than an old hierarchy storage system split across 16 projects. I spent the next six months developing a CICD pipeline in Jenkins that was used for all 16 of those applications. To me this was an easy decision. I was new and didn't have the existing knowledge of our complex system, and there was something new that needed someone to learn.

If you haven't heard it stated before, the most consitent thing in software development is that you will always need to be learning. And having this example is something that hiring managers tend to really enjoy. I found a need that would benefit the team and then stepped up to learn the new thing from scratch. That story has been a highlight of every interview that I've been in since then. Every good tech manager knows that you will need to learn new things on the fly to get things done, and demonstrating a way that you've done so will make them much more apt to see you as a fit for their role.

## Navigating Your Own Advancement (4 minutes) - currently 2.4

So, about now you've got to be asking "What should I be doing to bring this together for my career?", and I'm so glad that you've asked. 

The first step is that you have to find community with other developers. One great way of doing that is by taking part in conferences like this one. There are also some really great communities on Twitter (or X), Discord, Slack, and pretty much any social platform out there. Once you've found a community, you also have to engage in that community to really get the benefits. This may look like finding a mentor or offering to mentor others. It should 100% involve open, curious discussions about different skills and tools that others might bring up. Sharing knowledge helps us to diversify our skills, and one way that you might do this is by blogging or creating some type of content to help others. It's also really beneficial to collaborate with others about their content and ask questions that you might have surrounding their content. You really want to focus on building relationships within the community. You want to get to know people and let them get to know you. That's what networking is really about. It's not just connecting with a million people on LinkedIn, and asking them for a reference. These discussions also serve to help us determine what skills might be a good fit for our career. I personally keep a list of tech things I've heard about. I periodically will take these things and read about them before deciding if they are things that I should consider learning. I then keep a list of things that I'd like to learn. In general, you just have to keep learning and advancement in mind when you are engaging in whatever community that you find to be a part of. 

## Conclusion (1 minute) - 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6

Let's come together and embrace the power of collaboration, mentorship, and a culture of continuous learning! By working together, supporting and guiding each other, and always seeking new knowledge, we can not only achieve personal growth but also foster a thriving team environment.

None of these things were possible without a trusted community, learning, and fostering a culture around me where there's an expectation of advancement.
