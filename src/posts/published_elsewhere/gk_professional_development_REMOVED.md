### Behavioral Questions

There are many questions of this type that most people feel are dumb. In the end, your ability to work within the framework of these sometimes silly questions can demonstrate your ability to think critically under pressure. Many people don't do well with being questioned under pressure regardless of the topic. One of the best ways to do this well is just to practice. There are many lists of questions that can be found online as well as suggestions for how you might approach an answer. I'd urge you to think through answering many of these questions on your own so that you have some examples prepared already. 

When you get any question like "explain a time when..." feel free to bring the answer around to relate to a previously discussed topic. This will allow you to tell multiple parts of the same story, and ultimately make yourself more human. Stories that you want to use in these questions will be the times that you faced issues and were able to be a hero. What the interviewer really wants to know is how you face problems and whether you are willing to grow and learn in order to make things happen. The perfect stories for these questions look like "the team had [x] need and I learned to do [x] in order to fill that need". 

### Problem Solving

These are probably the most dreaded of all interview activities. These can be actual LeetCode puzzles, take home assignments, or whiteboard problems. The more that you know about data structures and algorithms, and the more coding puzzles that you've completed, the better you'll be at completing these types of interviews. 

LeetCode (or similar) tasks can be the most frustrating, particularly the ones that you are supposed to do at home. I specifically remember doing the one for Amazon some years ago and there were 2 puzzles that should each take a half hour. If you are currently employed and have children then it is highly likely that you'll be doing as I did and working on this after you should have been in bed. That's a horrible thing. I think that the take home assignments are basically the same issue. Practicing with coding puzzles is ultimately the only thing that's gonna help you with these. Unfortunately these don't test your ability to do the actual job. If you are finding yourself coming up against these in your job search then I'd suggest that you might spend a good chunk of time doing puzzles, but I wouldn't let it take up more than half of your time spent preparing for interviews and the like. 

Whiteboard interviews are widely despised in the industry, but I actually believe that, if handled correctly, that they do a much better job at testing your ability to solve problems. On the job, you will have access to ask questions of whoever is wanting something done. You'll have the ability to refine the requirements, and that's a big part of being successful in these interviews. You want to talk through everything when doing these. "We need a function [x] that takes [y, z, w] arguments and returns [q]" is a wonderful thing to get through at the beginning. It allows you to clarify the data that is available, and needed. I also like to include "We'll assume that there exists a function that does this other thing called [fubar]" and that can allow you to address the algorithm needed at a higher level than otherwise. If you are sorting something then it'd be really helpful to have a function that compares the priority/order of two objects. Ultimately the thing being determined in this interview is what your thought process and problem solving approach looks like.
