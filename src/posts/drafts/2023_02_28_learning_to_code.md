> Should aspiring developers use frameworks or AI like ChatGPT while learning to code?

This question arose in a recent meetup and the primary answers given were these:

- The struggle you experience early in your journey builds resilience. As the problems you face will get progressively harder in your career. 
- Focus on building a firm foundation.
- Great growth comes with great struggle (similar to building muscle memory)
- Learning to code yourself helps you figure out WHAT to modify in frameworks or AI driven solutions later. 
- Finally, the struggle gives you something to talk about in the interview.
