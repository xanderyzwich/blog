Over the last year, I've been discussing with Steve Hallman from [The Agile Couch](https://theagilecouch.com/) the virtues of Trunk Based Development (TBD), and how it makes work faster. As he is someone that I highly regard with software development process related things, I've been tinkering with it in my work, and wanted to share my experiences.
