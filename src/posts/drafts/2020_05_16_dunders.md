Python gives access to built in functionality so that custom classes get first class functionality. When you call built in functions like `len(thing)` then it is calling a 'magic method' or 'dunder method' (named for it's double underscores). In the case of `len(thing)` the method being called is `__len__`

for a in dir('a'):  # here's a list of them
    if '__' in a:
        print(a)
		
# `__add__` and `__radd__`

this + that calls __add__ behind the scenes
		
# `__add__`


# `__class__`

# `__contains__`


# `__delattr__`



# `__dir__`


# `__doc__`


# `__eq__`


# `__format__`


# `__ge__`


# `__getattribute__`


# `__getitem__`


# `__getnewargs__`


# `__gt__`


# `__hash__`


# `__init__`


# `__init_subclass__`


# `__iter__`
# `__le__`




# `__len__`


# `__lt__`


# `__mod__`


# `__mul__`


# `__ne__`


# `__new__`


# `__reduce__`


# `__reduce_ex__`


# `__repr__`


# `__rmod__`


# `__rmul__`


# `__setattr__`


# `__sizeof__`


# `__str__`


# `__subclasshook__`



Object oriented programming in Python is a bit different than something like Java. First off where Java polices encapsulation, Python does no such thing. Accessors and mutators (getters and setters) are not used as Python's approach is described as "we assume that everyone here is an adult" and dot notation is used to
