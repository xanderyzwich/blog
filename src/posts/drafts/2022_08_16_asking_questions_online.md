Welcome! Now, it turns out, asking for help with programming/coding issues is one of those things that is actually a learned skill that most people aren't born with, but it's a very important skill to develop along the way. For one thing, the odds of having your question actually answered go way up when posed in a way that minimizes the amount of work and learning about your project someone else needs to do in order to help you. I've linked a couple of articles here that I think really do a good job of explaining some great steps/strategies for asking for help.

I'm not a web dev myself, so there's a good chance I have no idea how to help you with your issue, but following these steps should get you a long way towards some good advice from the experienced web devs we have in this community. Welcome to :codeconnector:, we're really happy to have you!

By sheer coincidence, I was listening to a talk later that same day where the topic of making reproducible examples for submitting issues (for Svelte) came up, and I really thought about adding it to the post, but I thought it might come across as overkill. Might be a good citation for your blog post, though: https://youtu.be/dB_YjuAMH3o?t=1354
