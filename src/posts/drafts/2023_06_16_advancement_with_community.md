I graduated from college for Computer Engineering in December of 2013. I had been under of the misunderstanding that my degree would somehow make me hirable by itself. I was quite wrong, and ten months later I would get hired in my first development job. There was a 2 week boot camp, and then our 15 developers were split between 3 different states. My peers wound up in work heavy positions, and I accidentally wound up in a position that was more support than development. I was leading over a team of offshore developers, but was ultimately working alongside eight developers and I worked the support tickets. 

The same misunderstanding that I'd had about my degree getting me hired also made me believe that the work that I was doing would make me ready for my next position. I interviewed twice a year for some great position, but didn't get hired. One I remember particularly well and I bombed it. I asked about their use of Spring Framework, but when they turned around and asked questions about how I was using it I was clueless. It was then that I realized that I needed to be more intentional with my learning. 


## Motivating Your Learning

I had become close with one of my coworkers and we would discuss our interviews. Through our discussions we both came to realize that our knowledge was lacking. We started to share ebooks and online resources. These discussions inadvertently opened up a bit of community accountability to one another that we were studying and would have new resources to share. 

## Improving Communication of Technical Subjects

After gearing up for further advancement I eventually received a cold contact job offer. While in this position, I wound up being pulled into a community

```
My first so many interviews I was pretty insecure and just floundered. By the time I grew a little confident I landed my last role. I owe a lot of thanks to @Corey McCarty for  talking with me and helping me connect my past experience  with tech.
```
He had lots of applicable work experience, but it was hidden in automotive work. He just didn't know how to translate those things into open dialog with interviewers. 



### Dennis Kennetz:

```
One of the weird things I do is have shower conversations with myself about my projects and about my goals. These are sometimes out loud and sometimes just in my head. I don't do this just during interviews, I kind of do it all the time. I have practiced critically thinking about those conversations, and tailoring them when I don't think they make sense, or are too complicated. That helps with discussion portions of interviews. If I have interviews lined up, I'll look at the company's values, mission, find out about the team, the product, etc. I'll learn these things because companies will ask.  As for tech interviews, I don't really practice before an interview in that I'll try to cram the few days before - I try to practice all the time. So my advice is to consistently work on problems over time, and revisit them occasionally. This really helps them stick, and actually be applicable to real life when you see similar scenarios.

## Networking 

### Referrals
If you are submitting a resume to a company where you know somebody, and they are able to talk to the hiring manager and help you to get pulled for an interview. 

### Recommendations
If this person knows that you are looking for a position and they hear about one that might fit, then they will contact you about submitting for it. 

### Advocacy
This one is much more rare, but if there is a need without yet having a job listing, then this person will talk to the manager about the need and bring up your strengths that would be of great help to the organization, and they will recommend you as a member of the organization that would benefit the team.
