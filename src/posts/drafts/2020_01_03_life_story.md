# Life

I'll be tackling these topics separately, but first I'll tell a bit about myself. I'll do my best to keep this relavent, but feel free to jump ahead into the other articles.

## Young Life

I was a smart kid that got bored in school while everyone else was struggling to keep up.  I quit doing homework (for the most part) in the fourth grade, and barely scraped by through most of school without actually studying.

## College Dropout

After finishing high school I went directly into college without having really thought about what I wanted to do with my life. This lack of direction led me to having more interest in late nights and other students than in my studies. Early classes, full time work (dumb I know), and late nights out would eventually lead to my sleeping through classes after my first spring break. Being a commuter student made all of this all too easy.

## Customer Service

I started working the day after my sixteenth birthday and for some reason I still don't understand, I always put more effort into working than actually living my life. I moved my way through fast food, oil change shops, and restaurant work, and was never at a shortage of people to party with.  After I stopped going to college this just continued on for a few years without any real direction.

## Return to School

Eventually, I was faced with my lack of future in my actions. My friend's younger sister made a comment that she hoped she was never like me waiting tables and partying all the time without any direction. This shook my world as this particular person was someone I admired as tremendously intelligent. I told myself that I had to make some change and find direction.  After a bit of consideration I eventually decided that I would parry my love of writing and skill with grammar into becoming a computer programmer.  This would prove difficult.

## Studies

Having been such a lazy student previously, I had NO study habits. I would usually put assignments off until the last possible minute and do the bare minimum. I started back in college as a computer science major, but at some point while we were studying state diagrams the professor said "if this interests you at all then you should go over to the computer engineering department" and I took his advice. I transfered and decided to attempt a double major in Computer and Electrical Engineering. That's a LOT of work. I managed to find my way into what I call 'the semester from hell' and what I would later find out was a collection of classes that the faculty had been working to prevent being taken in the same semester.  

+ **Microcontrollers** - this one was fun having already worked with assembly
+ **Circuits 2** - Teacher was possibly too smart to teach undergrads
+ **Electronics 1** - Introduction to Transistors
+ **Signals and Systems** - This teacher and I didn't get along

This semester was TERRIBLE; all four of these classes had labs scheduled for 4 hours in the afternoon, and I only passed microcontrollers. BUT, it was this messed up semester that led me to make sizable changes in my academics.  Firstly, I realized that I didn't care about circuits and dropped the Electrical major. Secondly, I realized that I needed to make use of absolutely every opportunity to practice and study that was given to me. Just because the professor didn't care about attendance didn't mean that I could afford to miss class for no reason.  Any 'enrichment' assignments or additional exercises listed during lecture should be completed.  THIS is what would eventually lead to my graduation.

## Break into the industry

That major hop from computer science to computer engineering had an unintended consequence that I had classes that transfered over in place of what would have been internships. It turns out that graduating without internships is a really bad idea.  I was making decent money waiting tables and wasn't willing to take a cut in pay in order to move into programming. After graduating in December, I didn't find a position until September. I was finally hired by an Onsite/Offshore software development company that I'd not heard of before, and that business model is not designed to make things easy.
